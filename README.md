# DragonMail Random Name Generator, Godot demo

This project demonstrates how the [DragonMail Random Name Generator](https://github.com/sarrowsmith/DMRNG) can be used in Godot.

It is also the source for the [web browser version of the tool](https://sarrowsmith.itch.io/dmrng) made available on https://itch.io/ for [PROCJAM 2020](https://itch.io/jam/procjam).

I'm not making builds of this tool available for other platforms. Please clone [the repository](https://github.com/sarrowsmith/DMRNG-demo) (making sure that you've got the [main DMRNG submodule](https://github.com/sarrowsmith/DMRNG)) and build your own.
